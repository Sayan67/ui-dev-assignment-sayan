# Dashboard UI Development Assignment

A modern, responsive dashboard application built with React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui. This project demonstrates pixel-perfect implementation of a Figma design with advanced state management, animations, and comprehensive functionality.

## 🚀 Features

- **Dark/Light Theme Toggle**: Seamless theme switching with persistent user preferences
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Advanced State Management**: Redux Toolkit for efficient state handling
- **Interactive Components**: 
  - Real-time data visualization with charts
  - Sortable and paginated data tables
  - Interactive map visualization
  - Search functionality
  - Notifications system
- **Smooth Animations**: Microinteractions and transitions using Framer Motion
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation
- **Component Library**: shadcn/ui for consistent, accessible UI components

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18.0.0 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ui-dev-assignment-sayan.git
cd ui-dev-assignment-sayan
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

## 📦 Build for Production

## 🎨 Design Decisions

### Technology Stack
- **Vite**: Chosen for its fast build times and excellent developer experience
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and better developer experience
- **Redux Toolkit**: Modern Redux with less boilerplate for state management
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
- **shadcn/ui**: High-quality, accessible components that can be customized

### Architecture Patterns
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Modular, reusable components for maintainability
- **Container/Presentational Pattern**: Clear separation of logic and UI
- **Custom Hooks**: Encapsulated business logic for reusability
- **CSS Variables**: Dynamic theming support with CSS custom properties

### Performance Optimizations
- **Code Splitting**: Lazy loading for optimal bundle sizes
- **Memoization**: React.memo and useMemo for preventing unnecessary re-renders
- **Virtual Scrolling**: For large data sets in tables
- **Optimized Images**: Proper image formats and lazy loading

## 🎯 Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Pixel-Perfect Implementation
**Solution**: Using Figma's inspect tool to extract exact values for spacing, colors, and typography. Created a custom Tailwind configuration to match design tokens.

### Challenge 2: Dark Mode Implementation
**Solution**: Implemented CSS variables for colors and used Tailwind's dark mode class strategy for seamless theme switching.

### Challenge 3: Complex State Management
**Solution**: Utilized Redux Toolkit's slice pattern to organize state by feature, making it scalable and maintainable.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

1. **Testing Suite**: Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Add performance tracking and optimization
3. **Accessibility Enhancements**: Improve keyboard navigation and screen reader support
4. **Progressive Web App**: Convert to PWA for offline functionality
5. **Real-time Updates**: Implement WebSocket connections for live data
6. **Internationalization**: Add multi-language support
